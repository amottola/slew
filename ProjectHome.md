Python GUI library whose goals are ease of use, multiplatform support and extensibility. Features include (but are not limited to):

  * Object oriented design
  * All the standard widget set you may expect from a first-class GUI library, including items based widgets like grid and treeview controls
  * Loading interface definitions from XML resource files
  * GDI system allowing to draw onto icons, bitmaps and on top of widgets during paint events
  * Printing support
  * Extensible backends-based architecture (currently there is only one backend based on Qt)
